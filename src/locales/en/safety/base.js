	intro: "The mountain is a magnificent place to discover the natural environment, relax with family and friends or practice exciting sports activities; but at the same time presents a number of risks that must be taken wisely to enjoy the experience safely and comfortably. These risks may be due to unforeseen factors unconnected to the hiker, such as changing weather, rock breaks or avalanches, but the main causes of mountain accidents are due to the human factor: ignorance of the environment, inexperience or overestimation of one's abilities. It is during the summer months that the highest number of mountain accidents and rescues happen.",
	advice: 'If no experience, it is best to hire the services of a professional guide.',
