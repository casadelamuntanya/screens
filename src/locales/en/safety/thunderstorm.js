	thunderstorm: 'thunderstorm',
	introduction: 'Thunderstorms are the main danger of weather-related injuries and deaths. They form when warm and moist air rises to meet cold air from higher layers, condensing water vapour and generating dark grey vertically-developing clouds called cumulonimbus. When the electrical charges accumulated in the cloud are too intense, discharges are produced as lightnings and thunders. These storms are often accompanied by strong winds and precipitation in the form of heavy rain or hail.',

	in_case_of: 'In case of a thunderstorm',
	tips: {
		prevent: 'Be prepared. Consult the weather forecast and consider postponing the excursion if there is a risk of storm. Most electrical storms develop in the afternoon.',
		remove_metal: 'Avoid contact with any metallic element during the storm. Get rid of the backpack, belt, cloister, canes, ice axes, etc.',
		spread_group: 'Spread the group to minimize the strike of a lightning.',
		no_running: 'Do not run.',
		good_shelter: 'Find a safe haven. Buildings or vehicles are a good option.',
		bad_shelter: 'Stay away from spikes, hulls and any tall elements around you. Do not stand under isolated trees or under caves or natural cavities. Tents are not a safe haven.',
		safety_position: 'If you do not find a safe haven, adopt the safety position and wait for the storm to pass by.',
	},

	position: {
		position: 'safety position',
		introduction: 'The priority during a thunderstorm is to find a safe haven. As a last resort, one must adopt the safety position to reduce the probability of a lightning strike and its consequences.',
		crouch: 'Crouch down low. Do not lie down or sit on the floor.',
		ears: 'Protect your ears from loud thunder clap.',
		heels: 'Touch the heels of your feet together. Increases the chances of the electricity from a ground strike not to run into the body.',
		floor: 'Minimize contact with floor staying on the balls of your feet.',
	},

	calc_distance: {
		distance: 'distance',
		seconds: 'seconds',

		introduction: 'Knowing the distance from a storm can be of vital importance when it comes to finding a safe haven. By applying a simple formula, you can know the distance, in kilometres, just by counting the seconds between the lightning and the thunder.',

		direction: 'Repeat the measurement to know if thunderstorm is getting closer or moving far away.',

		explanation: 'Light travels at a speed of ~300,000 km/s, so the lightning is seen at the same time as the discharge. In contrast, sound travels at a speed of ~340 m/s at a temperature of 20 Â°C, that is why it usually takes several seconds for thunder to be heard.',
